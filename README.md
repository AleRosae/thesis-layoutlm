# LayoutLM for Visual Information Extraction (VIE)
This repository contains the code that I have wrote while carrying out experiments for my final thesis for the MA of Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna.

Experiments were carried out on two different public datasets: FUNSD and Kleister-NDA. The two folders contain all the code necessary to reproduce the experiments, along with the training logs that contain the final scores of the fine-tuning process. 

The fine-tuned models were uploaded on the HuggingFace Hub and can be found at the following links:
